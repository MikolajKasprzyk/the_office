## Overview
The "The Office Data Analysis" project explores character interactions, sentiment, and viewer ratings in the popular TV series "The Office." The project leverages Python and Pandas for data cleaning, joining, and transformation, followed by exporting the processed data for use in Tableau to create interactive dashboards.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection:
   - The Office Dataset: This dataset contains information about the characters and episodes of The Office (Link: [The Office Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset)).
   - Dialogue Transcript: The dataset provides complete dialogue transcripts for The Office (Link: [Dialogue Transcript](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasirkhalid24/the-office-us-complete-dialoguetranscript)).
   - The Office Episodes Data: This dataset includes details about The Office episodes (Link: [The Office Episodes Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/the-office-episodes-data)).

2. Data Processing:
   - Python and pandas are used for data cleaning, joining, and transformation. The datasets are combined to gain insights into character interactions, sentiment, and viewer ratings.

3. Visualizations:
   - Chord Diagram: Flourish Studio is employed to create interactive chord diagrams showcasing the relationships between characters and shared scenes (Link: [Chord Diagram Visualization](https://flourish.studio/)).
